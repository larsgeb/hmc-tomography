    "### Conclusions \n",
    "\n",
    "We can condense what we learned about `stepsize` and `amount_of_steps` for HMC in the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A longer total integration time (`stepsize * amount_of_steps`) will lead to more distant samplers. More distant samples leads to better MCMC mixing and thereby faster convergence. Increasing either parameter will therefore yield better convergence.\n",
    "2. ... **UNLESS** `stepsize` is increased so much that acceptance rate suffers. If no new models are accepted (because e.g. the `stepsize` is too big), the MCMC algorithm will perform poorly. and, ...\n",
    "3. ... **UNLESS** `amount_of_steps` is excessively high. Doing many steps in a trajectory will require many gradient evaluations, which might make the HMC algorithm run very slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal acceptance rate is found for Gaussians to be 0.65. We recommend, based on experience, to change the `stepsize` (by trial and error) such that the acceptance rate of the Markov chain lies between 0.5 - 0.9. This notebook will further on show how this can be done automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal amount of integration steps is unknown. We recommend, based on experience, to use between 3 - 15 integration steps."
