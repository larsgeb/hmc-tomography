This software provides all the ingredients to set up probabilistic (and deterministic) inverse
problems, appraise them, and analyse them. This includes a plethora of prior
distributions, different physical modelling modules and various MCMC (and
other) algorithms. 

In particular it provides prior distributions, physics and appraisal algorithms.
