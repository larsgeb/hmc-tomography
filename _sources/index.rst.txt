HMC Lab
#######

These pages provide the documentation of the Python side of HMC Lab. Here you'll find
notebooks detailing how different concepts in Bayesian inference using Markov chain
Monte Carlo work. In particular, extra attention is given on how to use the Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo algorithm on (your) geophysical inverse problems.

HMC Lab is tested on Python 3.8+. In theory, it should work well on any system that has
access to Conda.
